{"name":"Zork","tagline":"v0.1","body":"## Brief explanation\r\n\r\nThis is a class project from the UPC degree on Video game Development and Design. We are trying to recreate the game called Zork, a text-based game programmed in C. We were told to make our own version of the game with special features. And here I will be posting the process of creation of the game.\r\n\r\nBut first, here is the link to the original game, so you can have a glimpse of what it looks like: [Zork](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5)\r\n\r\nI also want to present a little bit how will my version look like.\r\n\r\n### Background:\r\nThis is Patrick. He stopped caring. Caring about him, his life, and his surroundings. He no longer keeps track of the days that he goes through since that fatidic accident...\r\nThat day changed his whole life. It has been three years now but he still remembers his wife laying on the floor, bleeding, and that man scaping through the window.\r\nThere hasn't been a night in which Patrick doesn't suffer from those horrible nightmares. The face of the murderer keeps appearing on his dreams, reviving all the feels: fear, sadness, anger...\r\nHe sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night sweating and screaming uncontrollably...\r\n\r\n**This is just the beggining...**\r\n![my zork map](http://subefotos.com/ver/?d42c8d621e43e8801c4266b41f1bb58co.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
